# Dictionary Web Application

A React-based dictionary web application that allows users to look up words and get definitions, synonyms, antonyms, and pronunciation.

## Features

- **Word Lookup**: Provides definitions, synonyms, antonyms, and pronunciation.
- **Interjections, Verbs, and Nouns**: Displays various forms and uses of the word.
- **API Integration**: Utilized the free [Dictionary API](https://api.dictionaryapi.dev/api/v2/entries/en/) to fetch word data.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling and creating a responsive design.
- **Axios**: For making API requests and handling responses.

## Learning Outcomes

- **API Interaction**: Gained hands-on experience in fetching and displaying data from an external API in a React application.
- **Responsive Design**: Leveraged Tailwind CSS to ensure the application looks great on all devices.
- **State Management**: Improved understanding of managing state in React for handling API data.
